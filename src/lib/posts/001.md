At First, I needed my own website to post the privacy policies, to upload my applications on some stores. Timely, I was so interested in Svelte-kit, and found Matheus Fantinel's blog, and thankfully, he opened his project on github as public. So I cloned it, and modified as much as I want. Added some new features like fixed and hidable nav bar, dark mode toggling buttons, and listing projects on resume. These are quite trivial, but the modification made me learn a lot of things.
Thanks to Matheus.
